npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

2. Setup amplify by linking the project with your newly created AWS accounty
```
amplify configure
```

3. Initialize Amplify 
```
amplify init
```

4. Add amplify build gradle plugin to the root gradle file

```
buildscript {
   repositories {
       google()
       jcenter()
   }

   dependencies {
       classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.2'

       // Add this line into `dependencies` in `buildscript`
       classpath 'com.amplifyframework:amplify-tools-gradle-plugin:1.0.2'
   }
}
allprojects {
   repositories {
       google()
       jcenter()
   }
}
// Add this line at the end of the file
apply plugin: 'com.amplifyframework.amplifytools'
```

5. Add the project dependencies to your app module's gradle files.
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-api:1.18.0'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-datastore:1.18.0'
